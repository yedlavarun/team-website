# Cardio Wars - Run Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed.
- VS Code with "Live Server" extension (recommended).

## 1. Backend Setup
The backend handles the database and territory logic.

1. Open a terminal in the project root.
2. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
   You should see: `Server running on port 3000` and `Connected to the SQLite database.`

## 2. Frontend Setup
The frontend displays the map and tracks your location.

1. Open `frontend/index.html` in VS Code.
2. Right-click and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
3. Accept the **Location Permission** request in your browser.

## 3. How to Play

Click **"Start Activity"**.
2. Walk or Run! (Or mock your location using Chrome DevTools -> More tools -> Sensors).
3. As you move, blue rectangles will appear on the map, marking your territory.
4. The dashboard will update your distance and score.

## Troubleshooting
- **Map not loading?** Check your internet connection (Leaflet needs to load tiles).
- **"Geolocation denied"?** Allow location access in your browser settings.
- **Scores not updating?** Ensure the backend server is running on port 3000.
